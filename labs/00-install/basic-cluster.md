# Install a basic cluster with kubeadm
We use `kubeadm init` and `kubeadm join` to initiate a cluster and join other nodes to the cluster.
- [More information about kubeadm arguments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/)
- [Using kubeadm init with configuration file](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-init/#config-file)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> we have a long running problem of not having a good mapping between flags and config.
